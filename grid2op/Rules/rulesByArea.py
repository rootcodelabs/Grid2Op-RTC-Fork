    This subclass combine :class:`PreventReconnection`, :class: `PreventDiscoStorageModif` to be applied on the whole grid at once,
    while a specifique method look for the legality of simultaneous actions taken on defined areas of a grid.
    An action is declared legal if and only if:

      - It doesn't reconnect more power lines than what is stated in the actual game _parameters
        :class:`grid2op.Parameters`
      - It doesn't attempt to act on more substations and lines within each area that what is stated in the actual game _parameters
        :class:`grid2op.Parameters`
      - It doesn't attempt to modify the power produce by a turned off storage unit
      
    Example
    ---------
    If you want the environment to take into account the rules by area, you can achieve it with:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        import grid2op
        from grid2op.Rules.rulesByArea import RulesByArea
        
        # First you set up the areas within the RulesByArea class
        my_gamerules_byarea = RulesByArea([[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11,12,13,14]])
        # Then you create your environment with it:
        NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"
        env = grid2op.make(NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT,gamerules_class=my_gamerules_byarea)
