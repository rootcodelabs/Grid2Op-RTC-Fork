class BaseHandler(RandomObject):
    """This is the base class that represents a time series "handler".
    
    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
    
    Each "handler" will be reponsible to produce the data for "one single type of elements" 
    of the grid. For example you will have 1 handler for "load_p", one for "load_q", another
    one for "load_p_forecasted" etc. This allows some great flexibility to the way you want 
    to retrieve data, but can be quite verbose as every type of data needs to be "handled".
    
    A "handler" will, for a certain type of data (*eg* load_p or maintenance etc.)
    handle the way this data type is generated.
    
    To be a valid "handler" an class must first inherit from :class:`BaseHandler` and 
    implements (for all types of handlers):
    
    - :func:`BaseHandler.initialize` : to initialize the handler from the environment 
      data (number of loads, lines etc.)
    - :func:`BaseHandler.done` : whether or not this "handler" is over or not.
    - :func:`BaseHandler.check_validity` : check if the input data are valid with the backend, 
      for example if you read from a csv
      number of columns should match number of element
    - :func:`BaseHandler.next_chronics` : called just before the start of a scenario.
    
    If the data represents "real time" data (*ie* the data seen by the agent in real 
    time in the observation) then it needs also to implement:
    
    - :func:`BaseHandler.load_next` : to "generate" data for the next steps
    
    If the data represents "forecast data" (*ie* the data accessed by the agent when it uses
    :func:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.simulate` or :class:`grid2op.simulator.Simulator`
    or :func:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.get_forecast_env`) then it needs to implement:
    
    - :func:`BaseHandler.forecast` : to retrieve the forecast at a given horizon
    
    And if the "handler" represents maintenance data, then it needs to implement:
    
    - :func:`BaseHandler.load_next` : that returns a boolean vector for whether or not 
      each powerline is in maintenance
    - :func:`BaseHandler.load_next_maintenance` : to "generate" data for the next steps
