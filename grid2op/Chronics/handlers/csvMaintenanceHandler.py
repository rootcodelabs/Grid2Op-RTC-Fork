class CSVMaintenanceHandler(CSVHandler):
    """Reads and produce time series if given by a csv file (possibly compressed).
    
    The separator used can be specified as input. 
    
    The file name should match the "array_name". If you want to use
    the maintenance file present in the file "my_maintenance_file.csv.gz"
    then you should create a CSVMaintenanceHandler with 
    `array_name="my_maintenance_file"`.
    
    The csv should be structured as follow:
    
    - it should not have any "index" or anything, only data used by 
      grid2op will be used
    - Each element powerline is represented by a `column`.
    - It should have a header with the name of the powerlines that
      should match the one in the environment. For example 
      if "0_1_0" is the name of a powerline in your environment, 
      then a column should be called "0_1_0".
    - each time step is represented as a `row` and in order. For example
      (removing the header), row 1 (first row) will be step 1, row 2 will
      be step 2 etc.
    - only binary data (0 or 1) should be present in the file. No "bool", 
      no string etc.
      
    .. warning::
        Use this class only for the MAINTENANCE and not for environment
        data ("load_p", "load_q", "prod_p" or "prod_v") nor for 
        forecast (in this case use :class:`CSVForecastHandler`) 
        nor for setting the initial state state (in this case use 
        :class:`JSONInitStateHandler`)
    
    This is the default way to provide data to grid2op and its used for
    most l2rpn environments.
