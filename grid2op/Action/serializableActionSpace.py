        Notes
        ------
        This utility requires you to specify on which bus you want to connect each end
        ("*origin*" or "*extremity*") of the powerline you want to reconnect.

        If you don't want to specify them, you can set them to ``0`` and it will reconnect them
        to the last known buses to which they were connected (this is automatically done by the
        Environment since version `0.8.0`).

        If you use `previous_action` it will modify the action **in place** which means that
        `previous_action` will be modified by this method.

        ----------
        line_id: ``int``
            The powerline to be disconnected.

        This methods allows to compute and return all the unitary topological changes that can be performed on a

        The changes will be performed using the "set_bus" method. The "do nothing" action will be counted once

        It returns all the "valid" topologies available at any substation (if `sub_id` is ``None`` -default)
        or at the requested substation.
        
        To be valid a topology must satisfy:
        
        - there are at least one side of the powerline connected to each busbar (there cannot be a load alone
          on a bus or a generator alone on a bus for example)

          substation
          
        .. note::
            We try to make the result of this function as small as possible. This means that if at any
            substation the number of "valid" topology is only 1, it is ignored and will not be added
            in the result.
            
            This imply that when `env.n_busbar_per_sub=1` then this function returns the empty list.
            
        .. note::
            If `add_alone_line` is True (again NOT the default) then if any substation counts less than 
            3 elements or less then no action will be added for this substation.
            
            If there are 4 or 5 elements at a substation (and add_alone_line=False), then only topologies
            using 2 busbar will be used.
            
        .. warning::
            This generates only topologies were all elements are connected. It does not generate 
            topologies with disconnected lines.
             
        .. warning::
            As far as we know, there are no bugs in this implementation. However we did not spend
            lots of time finding a "closed form" formula to count exactly the number of possible topologies.
            This means that we might have missed some topologies or counted the same "results" multiple
            times if there has been an error in the symmetries.

            If ``True`` (default) then topologiees where 1 line side is "alone" on a bus
            are valid and put in the output (more topologies are considered). If not

        Redispatching action are continuous action. This method is an helper to convert the continuous
        action into "discrete actions" (by rounding).

        The number of actions is equal to num_down + num_up (by default 10) per dispatchable generator.


        This method acts as followed:

        - it will divide the interval [-gen_max_ramp_down, 0] into `num_down`, each will make
          a distinct action (then counting `num_down` different action, because 0.0 is removed)
        - it will do the same for [0, gen_maw_ramp_up]

        .. note::
            With this "helper" only one generator is affected by one action. For example
            there are no action acting on both generator 1 and generator 2 at the same

        Parameters
        ----------
        action_space: :class:`ActionSpace`
            The action space used.

        num_down: ``int``

        num_up: ``int``
            In how many intervals the "redispatch up" will be split

        max_ratio_value: ``float``
            Expressed in terms of ratio of `gen_max_ramp_up` / `gen_max_ramp_down`, it gives the maximum value
            that will be used to generate the actions. For example, if `max_ratio_value=0.5`, then it will not
            generate actions that attempts to redispatch more than `0.5 * gen_max_ramp_up` (or less than
            `- 0.5 * gen_max_ramp_down`). This helps reducing the instability that can be caused by redispatching.

        This function returns the list of unary actions that you can perform in order to get back to the "fully meshed" / "initial" topology.

        Parameters
        ----------
        observation:
            The current observation (the one you want to know actions to set it back ot)
        Notes
        -----
        In this context a "unary" action, is (exclusive or):

        - an action that acts on a single powerline
        - an action on a single substation
        - a redispatching action (acting possibly on all generators)
        - a storage action (acting possibly on all generators)

        The list might be relatively long, in the case where lots of actions are needed. Depending on the rules of the game (for example limiting the
        action on one single substation), in order to get back to this topology, multiple consecutive actions will need to be implemented.

        It is returned as a dictionnary of list. This dictionnary has 4 keys:

        - "powerline" for the list of actions needed to set back the powerlines in a proper state (connected). They can be of type "change_line" or "set_line".
        - "substation" for the list of actions needed to set back each substation in its initial state (everything connected to bus 1). They can be
          implemented as "set_bus" or "change_bus"
        - "redispatching": for the redispatching actions (there can be multiple redispatching actions needed because of the ramps of the generator)
        - "storage": for action on storage units (you might need to perform multiple storage actions because of the maximum power these units can absorb / produce )
        - "curtailment": for curtailment action (usually at most one such action is needed)

        After receiving these lists, the agent has the choice for the order in which to apply these actions as well as how to best combine them (you can most
        of the time combine action of different types in grid2op.)

        .. warning::

            It does not presume anything on the availability of the objects. For examples, this funciton ignores completely the cooldowns on lines and substations.

        .. warning::

            For the storage units, it tries to set their current setpoint to `storage_setpoint` % of their storage total capacity. Applying these actions
            at different times might not fully set back the storage to this capacity in case of storage losses !

        .. warning::

            See section :ref:`action_powerline_status` for note on the powerline status. It might happen that you modify a powerline status using a "set_bus" (ie
            tagged as "susbtation" by this function).

        .. warning::

            It can raise warnings in case it's not possible, with your action space, to get back to the original / fully meshed topology

        Examples
        --------

        You can use it like this:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import grid2op

            env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"
            env = grid2op.make(env_name)
            obs = env.reset(seed=1)

            # perform a random action
            obs, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
            assert not done # you might end up in a "done" state depending on the random action
            
            acts = obs.get_back_to_ref_state()
            print(acts)
